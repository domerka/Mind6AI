This project is a very barebone representation of the board game called mind6 written in python tkinter. https://tarsasjatekok.com/tarsasjatek/vigyaz-z-6-1994

I created this project with the intention of making it learn by itself so I could become better at the game. I am yet to implement the AI part of it, but I am actively researching it.
